          <p>Questions in this quiz will be in the form of a grid with one element missing. The grid will follow certain rule(s) / pattern(s). Once you have worked out the relationship between the grid elements, choose which of the options fits the pattern. The number of options to choose from will vary between questions, but the majority will have 6 choices. In this example, notice that each row has one of each shape. Thus the square is the correct answer.</p>
