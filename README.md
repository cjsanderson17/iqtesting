Here's a list of things to do:
  - Grey out finish button rather than hiding it
  - Locally save questionID's so question index can be linked (so when analysing data I know which question is which,
    as currently they are saved as q1, q2, etc.
  - Add information page at start
  - Add finish button functionality
  - Calculate score
  - Send data to database
  - Help page
  - Add pictures to buttons
  - Create questions
